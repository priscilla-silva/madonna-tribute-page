            <h3>Madonna Louise Ciccone, better known simply as Madonna, was born on August 16, 1958. She is an American singer-songwriter and
            actress. She is considered one of the most influential figures in popular culture and has often been referred to as the
            "Queen of Pop". Madonna is noted for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production, songwriting, and
            visual presentation. She is also known for pushing the boundaries of artistic expression in mainstream music, while
            maintaining control over every aspect of her career. Her works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and
            religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim.

            Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and
            vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, she rose to solo stardom with her debut studio album, Madonna
            (1983). She followed it with a series of successful albums, including all-time bestsellers Like a Virgin (1984), True
            Blue (1986) and The Immaculate Collection (1990) as well as Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on
            a Dance Floor (2005). Madonna has amassed many number-one singles throughout her career, including "Like a Virgin", "La
            Isla Bonita", "Like a Prayer", "Vogue", "Take a Bow", "Frozen", "Music", "Hung Up", and "4 Minutes".
            <br>
            <br>
            Madonna's popularity was enhanced by roles in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), A
            League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996). While Evita won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her
            other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded the company Maverick in 1992; it included
            Maverick Records, one of the most successful artist-run labels in history. Her other ventures include fashion brands,
            children's books, health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded the Ray of Light
            Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006.
            <br>
            <br>
            With sales of over 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is noted as the best-selling female music artist of all time
            by Guinness World Records. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and
            holds the record for the most number-one singles by a female artist in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United
            Kingdom. With a revenue of over U.S. $1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing solo
            touring artist of all time. Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of
            eligibility. She was ranked as the greatest woman in music by VH1, and as the greatest music video artist of all time by
            MTV and Billboard. Rolling Stone also listed Madonna among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest
            Songwriters of All Time.
